title: "Week 10: Individual Contributions"
---



I’ve continued making smaller contributions on Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap. Interestingly, all of the contributions I’ve made have been fitness-related. On wikipedia, I edited the content of a page discussing eccentric weight training.

The existing article gave a very technical and unintuitive definition - I made the article more actionable. I’ve found that a lot of people who write or talk about fitness actually have very little idea of what’s going on. Personally, I developed a strong intuition of biomechanics by training calisthenics on my own and listening to people who are extremely fit but not on steroids. This is what allows me to fill the gaps. On OpenStreetMap, it’s difficult to find places in NYC that aren’t already marked, so I tried to think of a niche location category. I eventually noticed that small outdoor calisthenics parks (with pull-up bars and parallel bars) were typically unmarked. I marked the ones in StuyTown and Tompkins Square Park.
