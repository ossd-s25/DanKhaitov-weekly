title: "Week 3: Browser Extension and Group Projects"
---


My team chose to build a website that tracks time spent on each website. Our group work was divided pretty evenly on all dimensions of this project, but I really found the programming the most engaging. I’m not interested in working on contributing and license files. I did find that if a project is sufficiently small, it doesn’t even make sense to divide up the work and do it asynchronously. We ended up sitting behind the same screen for a few hours and completed most of it in one sitting.

I do find that I always look for overly ambitious projects and often need to dial things back when in a school environment. Not that this happened here, but if I push for a project my teammates have no background knowledge on, it’s not exactly fair to them. 

For the larger open source project, I am itching to contribute to a distributed systems project like etcd or Kafka. Frankly, I don’t know much about these and have never used them, which of course will make our professor concerned, but it seems like all the rage among my friends who are working full-time already. They just yap about Kafka, Kubernetes, Docker, Redis, etc…
