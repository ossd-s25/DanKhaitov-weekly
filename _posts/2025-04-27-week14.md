## Progress on my own project
I’ve finally completed one of my code contributions for Gleam. One of the existing issues complained that a certain erlang script used for compilation was left over in the final build of gleam projects, and this file could not be compiled by integrations that used erlc. Moreover, this file is not needed for anything after compilation.

I solved this issue by adding a function that recursively searches and deletes appearances of the file at the very end of the compilation. This code was written in Rust. I also had to create an integration test, which means creating a gleam project and adding a script that compiles/builds the project and then checks that the file has been deleted. All of this required me to become familiar with bash and make sure my script would get called by the project’s makefile. 


## Other Groups’ presentations
My favorite project that other groups worked on was Lucide. I am by no means an artist, but I do appreciate and enjoy drawing and design. This would be my project of choice if I decided that I didn’t want to work primarily on code contributions. The group that worked on AI also seemed pretty impressive and encouraging - even as college students, we can make contributions to real-world projects.
