title: "Week 2: Codes of Conduct"
---



Open source projects depend on people working together across long periods of time, so it makes sense to set a standard for behavior and communication. The Go code of conduct and the contributor covenant seem quite similar, but the Go project has extra sections on the importance of healthy debate and not the absence of it. Also, Go has dedicated Project Stewards, who deal with issues like bad behavior. Overall, the Go project just feels more specific.

[Eclipse’s code of conduct](http://eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php) feels much more detailed with respect to conflict resolution and banning. Moreover, they have an extra section on “No Retaliation,” which suggests they may have had a history of poorly behaving contributors. Sugar Labs’ code of conduct is based on Ubuntu’s code of conduct, yet feels more similar to Go’s code of conduct in terms of tone and highlights. 

I feel that these codes of conduct are largely redundant and doubt that anyone actually reads them until it’s time to report someone. Python’s code of conduct also falls into this category. The only difference with Python’s is an extra section on in-person event policies, like no guns. For any project that I want to make open source, I would just use the Contributor covenant and leave an email for complaints.
